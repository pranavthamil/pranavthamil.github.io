          Hello and welcome! My name is Pranav, and this website is a small introduction about me.
          I’m passionate about learning new technologies, exploring creative ideas, and finding ways to
          make everyday life more efficient and enjoyable. I enjoy working on small projects that help
          people, whether that’s through web design, data visualization, or simple coding experiments.
          Outside of tech, I love reading, traveling, and spending time outdoors. I believe that curiosity
          and creativity are key to continuous growth, there’s always something new to learn, and I’m
          excited to keep exploring and sharing that journey here.
        </p>
