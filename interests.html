      <h2>Exploring Creativity and Technology</h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest interests lies in the space where creativity meets technology. I’ve always been fascinated
        by how ideas can be transformed into something real, whether it’s a small website, a visual design, or a data
        project that helps explain a complex topic. I enjoy the process of taking an abstract concept and breaking it
        down into smaller, solvable parts. That curiosity has pushed me to experiment with web design, simple
        programming projects, and data visualization. Each time I build something new, I discover a new way to express
        creativity through logic and structure.

        Beyond technology, I love photography and storytelling. I think both share a similar principle: capturing a
        moment or an idea in a way that connects with people. Photography, for me, is about noticing the details,
        lighting, colors, and composition, while storytelling lets me communicate ideas in a way that feels personal
        and clear. These hobbies balance my technical side and keep me curious about the world. Whether I’m behind a
        camera or designing a layout, I’m constantly learning how to see things from new perspectives.
